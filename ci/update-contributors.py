"""Regenerate the contributor credits from this repository's own history.

The wall is drawn from a JSON snapshot. Nothing in it is typed by hand, so the credits track the
repository instead of drifting away from it: a new contributor appears, an existing one gains
commits and areas, and a translator picks up the language they worked on, all by running this and
committing the result. The GitHub Action runs it on a schedule, which is what keeps the wall
current without anybody thinking about it.

    python ci/update-contributors.py            regenerate the snapshot
    python ci/update-contributors.py --check    fail if it is out of date (for CI)
    python ci/update-contributors.py --no-network   keep known accounts, fetch nothing

What is derived, and from where:

    commits     `git shortlog` over authored, non-merge commits reachable from HEAD. Only HEAD: an
                author whose work sits on another branch is not credited for something this app does
                not contain, and counting every ref would double-count what a fork shares with its
                upstream.
    areas       the paths each person's commits touched, so a badge is a fact and not a guess.
    languages   the `values-<lang>` directories they touched, which is what a translator did.
    account     the GitHub account behind a commit email, asked of the API. Where an email is not
                tied to an account there is no photo and the wall draws the person's initial.

Everyone with a commit in HEAD is included, however few. The only table below is the one thing git
cannot tell us: which several commit identities are the same person.

Pictures are not carried in the app: the snapshot points at each account's avatar on GitHub, and
the app fetches and caches them itself. So this needs no image library, and the repository grows
no binary.

Requires: git; `gh` (authenticated) only to resolve accounts.
